# Summary of the project
 
 Built an application that is able to recognize the 100 most popular meme templates from https://imgflip.com .
 Firstly, I used Beautiful Soup to scrape 10000+ memes for training and testing. Afterwards, I designed a deep CNN image classification model using Tensorflow. For visualization, I used a Django server and simple HTML and CSS.
