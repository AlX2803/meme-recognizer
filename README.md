# Summary of the project
 
 Built an application that is able to recognize the 100 most popular meme templates from https://imgflip.com .
Firstly, I designed a deep CNN image classification model using Tensorflow. Afterwards, I used Beautiful Soup to scrape 10000+ memes to train and test the model. For visualization, I used simple HTML and CSS.
